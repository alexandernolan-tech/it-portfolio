# 🌐 IT Troubleshooting Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of hands-on troubleshooting case studies.  
I use virtualized test environments and real-world problem scenarios to break systems on purpose, diagnose failures, and document clear, repeatable paths to resolution.

My focus is developing strong analytical skills across Windows systems, networking fundamentals, documentation integrity, and application-level behavior — all while writing clear, reproducible IT-style documentation.

## 🔧 Featured Case Studies

### 🗂 **Windows File Picker Shell Corruption**  
Troubleshot and repaired a complex WinUI/shell failure where Open/Save dialogs stopped responding across applications. Used UI subsystem analysis, shell component testing, and log review to restore normal functionality.

### 📡 **Home WiFi Random Disconnects**  
Diagnosed intermittent multi-device WiFi drops by analyzing router interference, firmware instability, and DHCP behavior. Documented short-term fixes and long-term reliability guidelines.

### 🎮 **Sims 4 DLC Not Recognized**  
Investigated DLC detection failures caused by corrupted directory structure and metadata inconsistencies. Rebuilt missing paths, validated permissions, and restored proper content recognition.

### 🧩 **Script Mod Loading Conflict**  
Applied structured 50/50 isolation (binary search troubleshooting) to identify one incompatible script mod blocking the entire loader. Rebuilt the mod stack and documented a reusable conflict-resolution workflow.

### 🌐 **DNS Misconfiguration & Network Failure**  
Simulated a DNS outage inside a Windows VM by assigning invalid DNS servers. Compared IP vs. hostname behavior, used `nslookup` to confirm resolver failure, flushed cached records, corrected DNS configuration, and restored normal resolution.

## 🗄 Documentation & Systems Reliability

### 📁 **GitHub 404 Link Troubleshooting (Relative Path Failure)**  
Diagnosed recurring GitHub 404 errors caused by relative links and mismatched filenames inside the README. Analyzed link behavior across GitHub, LinkedIn, and external renderers. Replaced all broken relative paths with absolute GitHub URLs, corrected inconsistent filenames, and restored full documentation integrity.

## 🖥 Technical Focus Areas

- Windows troubleshooting  
- Networking fundamentals (DNS, DHCP, routing, connectivity)  
- Virtualized environments (VirtualBox / VMs)  
- Application & system-level diagnostics  
- Documentation reliability & cross-platform path behavior  
- Log analysis & root-cause isolation  
- System configuration & dependency resolution  
- Repeatable troubleshooting & knowledge-base style writing  

---

## 📚 Methodology

My case studies emphasize:  
- **Structured troubleshooting** using isolation, iterative testing, and reproducibility  
- **Clear documentation** (Symptoms → Investigation → Root Cause → Resolution → Verification)  
- **Understanding system behavior**, not just applying fixes  
- **Preventative guidance** and long-term reliability thinking  
- **Consistency in naming conventions, linking, and documentation structure**
